To calculate the actual distribution of number of children in each family, compute the probability mass function, which maps values to their probabilities. These probabilities are calculated by dividing frequency values by the total sample size.
The actual mean number of children in each family is: 1.024205155043831

To calculate the biased distribution, multiply each probability by the associated number of children value.
The biased mean number of children in each family is: 2.403679100664282

There is a biased because families with children are more likely to spend time with other famlies with children, as children play with each other. Therefore, the biased mean should be larger than the actual mean.
