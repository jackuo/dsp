[Think Stats Chapter 4 Exercise 2](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2005.html#toc41) (a random distribution)

>> REPLACE THIS TEXT WITH YOUR RESPONSE

This was such an interesting exercise! All work done in *chap04ex*

After generating 1000 random values between 0 and 1 using np.random.random, I first plotted their PMF. The resulting graph looked like a barcode, with every random number mapping to probability 0.0010 or 1/1000, which is expected!

Then, I plotted the CDF, which looked like an almost perfect diagonal line from left to right from the origin to the top right corner at (1, 1), showing that the distribution of the numbers is uniform.
