>> REPLACE THIS TEXT WITH YOUR RESPONSE

Using the variable totalwgt_lb, investigate whether first babies are lighter or heavier than others.

- The mean of weight for first babies is 7.201 and the mean of weight for "other" babies is 7.326, indicating that first babies are on average lighter than "other" babies.

Compute Cohenâ€™s effect size to quantify the difference between the groups. How does it compare to the difference in pregnancy length?

- Cohen's effect size for weight is -0.0887, and Cohen's effect size for pregnancy length is 0.0289, indicating that while the pregnancy length of first children is longer, their weight is smaller, and this difference in weight between first borns and "other" borns is larger in magnitude than that of pregnancy length. However, both effect sizes are too small to consider significant.
